From this mentorship, I hope to gain a deep understanding of both fundamental and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning, focusing on practical applications that bridge theory and real-world usage. As I transition from a different field into data science, I am eager to learn how to translate cutting-edge research into products, with particular interest in reinforcement learning's potential in tech industries. I seek guidance on developing the necessary skills to thrive in competitive internships and roles, leveraging your dual experience in academia and industry at companies like Microsoft AI and Apple.
